ðŸŽ‰ My First Laravel/React/Inertia Project with Heroku Deployment ðŸš€

Iâ€™m proud to share my first major milestone as a junior web developer at BeCode! This project is part of the Introduction phase from the official Laravel website, where I built a full-stack app using Laravel, React, and Inertia.js, and deployed it successfully on Heroku.

Project duration 3 days.

ðŸŒŸ Main Features

	â€¢	Authentication System: The app includes fully functional login, registration, and password reset features, set up using Laravel Breeze.
	â€¢	React & Inertia.js: I integrated React as the frontend framework, with Inertia.js handling the seamless, single-page app experience.
	â€¢	Heroku Deployment: My app is live on the web, thanks to Herokuâ€™s cloud platform, with an add-on for postgres database management.


ðŸŽ¯ Why This Is Important to Me

Completing this project marks a significant achievement in my journey as a junior web developer. It proves I can:

	â€¢	Build a backend with Laravel.
	â€¢	Integrate a React frontend with Inertia.js for a single-page experience.
	â€¢	Successfully deploy a full-stack web application to the cloud.

This is just the beginning! More projects and exciting challenges are on the way! ðŸ’»ðŸŒŸ
